## Cell Ranger Installation Steps

Follow the [official Cell Ranger installation guide](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/tutorial_in) to install Cell Ranger:

1. Login to a remote machine.
2. Download Cell Ranger using the provided link.
3. Extract the downloaded tarball: `tar -xzvf cellranger-<version>.tar.gz`.
4. Add the Cell Ranger directory to your PATH: `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/cellranger`.

## Running Cell Ranger Tutorial

After installing Cell Ranger, follow the [tutorial on running your sample](https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/software/pipelines/latest/using/mkfastq).

For easier analysis, set intron mode to `False` during the analysis. This excludes transcripts aligned to intronic regions, making the data noise-free.

## Data Processing Steps

1. In the output folder, navigate to `sample_name > outs > raw_feature_bc_matrix`.
2. Copy the contents of this folder to a separate directory with the `sample_name`.
3. As a prerequisite check, examine whether the number of cells captured in your sequencing matches the targeted cell count using the `web_summary.html` file.

## Handling Replicates

If the sequencing run contains replicates of the same sample:

1. Run each replicate individually through Cell Ranger.
2. Combine the results downstream in tools like Seurat and perform comparisons.
